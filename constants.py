num_channels = 3 # rgb!
image_size = 200 # each raw image is 1600x1600. I think each output should be too, but testing may be faster on lower res
epochs = 100
n_critic = 1 # the number of times we'll train the discriminator before going on to the generator
# ^ the original paper chose 5

# custom hyperparameters--determine things about loss:
chi = 0.9 # how much we care about SSIM vs L2 when creating content loss
# ^ not sure if we're even going to use L2 after all.

# learning rates: a few different strategies:
# 1.
# idea here comes from https://towardsdatascience.com/10-lessons-i-learned-training-generative-adversarial-networks-gans-for-a-year-c9071159628, called TTUR
gen_learn_rate = 0.0001

# 2.
# this idea I've seen more frequently, the idea is to give the generator more ability to shift rapidly to outwit the discriminator

# Very low for both

# no idea what effect this has!
