# junocam_GAN

Purpose: the idea here is to implement a GAN and train it to automatically process images of space. There's lots of unprocessed space data out there, and I've always wanted to make a data-driven solution to automating the processing of it. One can access raw images taken by spacecraft, for instance from the JunoCam project, found here: https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing/

This project is currently a work-in-progress and it breaks frequently, because GANs are sorta hard to train and I'm just a beginner. Hopefully we can produce some pretty images soon though!
